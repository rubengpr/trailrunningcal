name: react-doctor
description: Run React Doctor diagnostics for lint, accessibility, bundle size, and architecture. Use only when the user explicitly invokes `$react-doctor` or `/doctor`, or explicitly asks to run React Doctor. Do not trigger for ordinary React work, generic scan or cleanup requests, feature completion, bug fixes, reviews, or pre-commit checks.

# React Doctor

Scans React codebases for security, performance, correctness, and architecture issues. Outputs a 0–100 health score.

Only run React Doctor after an explicit user invocation. Never run it automatically because React code changed or as part of feature completion, bug fixing, review, cleanup, or pre-commit validation.

## Explicit regression scan

Run `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff` and check the score did not regress.

If the score dropped, fix the regressions before committing.

## For general cleanup or code improvement:

Run `npx react-doctor@latest --verbose` (without `--diff`) to scan the full codebase. Fix issues by severity — errors first, then warnings.

## /doctor — full local triage workflow

When the user types `/doctor`, says "run react doctor", or asks for a full triage / cleanup pass (not just a regression check), fetch the canonical local-triage playbook and follow every step in it:

```bash
curl --fail --silent --show-error \
  --header 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  https://www.react.doctor/prompts/react-doctor-agent.md
```

The playbook is the single source of truth — a scan → filter → triage → fix → validate loop that edits the working tree directly (never commits, never opens PRs). Updating the prompt at its source updates every agent on its next fetch — no skill reinstall needed.

Pair it with the matching per-rule prompts at `https://www.react.doctor/prompts/rules/<plugin>/<rule>.md` (fetched on demand inside the playbook) so each fix uses the canonical, reviewer-tested recipe.

## Configuring or explaining rules

When the user wants to understand a rule, disagrees with one, or wants to disable / tune which rules run (not fix code), use the `doctor-explain` skill (alias `/doctor-config`). Start with `npx react-doctor@latest rules explain <rule>`, then apply the narrowest control via `npx react-doctor@latest rules disable|set|category|ignore-tag …`, which edits your `doctor.config.*` (or `package.json#reactDoctor`).

## Command

```bash
npx react-doctor@latest --verbose --diff
```
